# Chapter 1
## Introduction

This chapter outlines the systematic design of a Lead controller aimed at satisfying strict performance requirements. The controller is designed to achieve over 90% accuracy in position tracking, a 20% improvement in settling time, a maximum of 5% overshoot, and robustness against system uncertainties and component tolerances. MATLAB's PID Tuner tool was used for fine-tuning the controller parameters, and the tuned controller was exported to Simulink for simulation with the KittiCopter system.
