# EEE3094S-2023: Control Systems Labs

Welcome to my repository for the EEE3094S control systems course at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This repository houses both the code and reports for the labs I've undertaken.

## Structure

There are three labs, and each lab has its own dedicated folder. Within each folder, you can find:

- The lab manual
- My workings and solutions
- The code associated with that lab

## Feedback

I welcome constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you find any errors or have recommendations, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
